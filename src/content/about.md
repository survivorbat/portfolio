## Maarten van der Heijden

I started using a desktop pc when i was around 6 years old, I would spend my time playing
NinjaKiwi bloons games and was blown away when I first started using Skype to chat online
with people my age. During those days I decided that I wanted to build my own website one day.

When I became 11 years old I finally made this wish come true and I built a small fan website
for a movie I really liked with a tool that consisted of drag 'n dropping images on the screen
and then uploading the html files through DirectAdmin. Around this time I also started
fiddling with PHP.

At age 17 I finally understood how to build websites properly with php, js, html and css. 
I worked on quite a lot of small-scale projects for my friends at school and I also built
an online math-game called rekengame.nl with the CodeIgniter PHP framework. These apps used
SQL databases, XML files and ini files to store data. Not because it was the best format
to store data in for that particular application, but because I wanted to try something new
in each project.

When I turned 19 I started studying Information technology at [Avans University](https://avans.nl "Avans University's website")
where I finally started to use OOP in my projects and realize the beauty of webservices.
Due to my past experiences and my excitement for software development I was able to finish
both year 1 and 2 in school year 2018-2019 with the help of my professors. This meant that I
could go on an internship in my second year and finish college in 3 years instead of 4.

During my internship at [Developers.nl](https://developers.nl "The Developers.nl website") I learned **so much more** about Docker,
Ansible, PHP best practices, Symfony, Linux servers and what it is like to be a real developer.
This is all thanks to my amazing colleagues and intensive code reviews.
In january of 2019 I was capable of setting up an entire CI/CD pipeline using Ansible and Docker
so that my applications could be deployed and set up automatically without human intervention
on a server (like this website).

After finishing my internship with a 9 out of 10 I decided that I wanted to continue working at [Developers.nl](https://developers.nl "The Developers.nl website")
part-time while in my last years of college so that I could continue to learn backend and 
DevOps techniques in a professional environment. It was also around this time that I started
to dual-boot all my computers so that I could use Linux in my development environment everywhere. Besides
this I also upgraded my shared hosting account to a virtual server so that I could figure out
server management through SSH.

### Future plans

Now that I achieved my dream of building a website and hosting it myself, I've set my sights
on these new goals:
* Try out kubernetes and (perhaps) deploy a website/system with it
* Build a (small) .io game like [agar.io](http://agar.io "The Agar.io browser game") or [slither.io](http://slither.io "The Slither.io browser game").
* Try out Arch Linux

I wonder what the future holds! :)
