## My experience

Most of my projects on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/survivorbat "My GitHub profile") contain technologies
that I like working with like Symfony, Docker, JavaScript frameworks and CSS frameworks like 
Bootstrap. I always use Git to keep track of changes I make to my code. My preferred
IDE at the moment is PHPStorm or any other Jetbrains editor like IntelliJ or WebStorm.

I also enjoy working with JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS or VueJS, although I personally
prefer backend technologies.
