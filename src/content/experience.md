## My experience

Most of my projects on my [Github page](https://github.com/survivorbat) contain technologies
that I like working with like Symfony, Docker, Javascript frameworks and CSS frameworks like 
Bootstrap. I always use Git to keep track of changes I make to my code. My preferred
IDE at the moment is PHPStorm or any other Jetbrains editor like Intellij or WebStorm.

I also enjoy working with Javascript frameworks like ReactJS or VueJS, although I personally
prefer backend technologies.
