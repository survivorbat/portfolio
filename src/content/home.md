## Maarten.dev

Welcome to maarten.dev! This is the web page where I showcase my projects, talk
about my experience in (web) development and show off some of the stuff and techniques that I
learned along the way. I've also put down a list of things that I want to research and learn in the future.

You can find more information on who I am and why I love what I do on the [about me](/about "About me page") page.

Feel free to have a look at [what I've worked on](/projects) in the past! :)
