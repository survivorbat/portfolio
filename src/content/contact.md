## Contact me

I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maarten-van-der-heijden-webdev/) profile where
I put all my professional information like work experience and certificates. 

I also have a public
[Github page](https://github.com/survivorbat) where I keep both new and old projects on display to
show the world what I'm currently working on in my private time. Most of the (public) repositories
on my page are archived and are either inactive or from past school projects.

I store my Docker images over at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/survivorbat). I'm afraid most of my work on there is private however, I don't have many public images.

Finally, you can also contact me directly through e-mail, send me a message on [djbatcat@gmail.com](mailto:djbatcat@gmail.com).
I must note however that this mail address will soon change to me@maarten.dev or something similar.
