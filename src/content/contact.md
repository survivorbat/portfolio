## Contact me

I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maarten-van-der-heijden-webdev/) profile where
I keep any professional information like work experience and certificates. 

I also have a public
[Github page](https://github.com/survivorbat) where I keep new and old projects on display to
show the world what I'm currently working on in my private time and to give some examples
of programs and applications that I've worked on in the past. Most of the (public) repositories
on my page are archived and are either inactive or from past school projects.

I also have a [DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/u/survivorbat) where I keep Docker images
of my applications. I'm afraid most of my work on there is private and you won't find anything
really useful on there unfortunately.

Finally you can also contact me directly through e-mail, send me a message on [me@maarten.dev](mailto:me@maarten.dev)
